Developing **GameBoy** games in 2025 is a fascinating challenge that blends nostalgia with extreme technical constraints. But what if we could use **TypeScript** — with all its modern power and features — to create retro games? This is exactly the problem I wanted to solve with **GBTS** (GameBoy TypeScript).

## The Problem: Between Nostalgia and Technical Complexity

Traditional GameBoy development involves:

- **C programming** with archaic tools
- **Manual memory management** in an ultra-constrained environment
- **Complex optimizations** to respect hardware limitations
- **Huge learning curve** for modern developers

I had started using **ts2c**, a TypeScript to C transpiler, but quickly realized its limitations. With the emergence of **LLMs** and their ability to understand and transform code, I saw a revolutionary opportunity.

## The Solution: GBTS, Intelligent AI-Powered Transpilation

**GBTS** is a CLI that transforms TypeScript code into GameBoy-optimized C code, using artificial intelligence for intelligent and contextual transpilation.

### Revolutionary Architecture: The 2-Pass System

```bash
# Simple installation
npm install -g gbts

# Transpile a file
gbts --path hello-world.ts

# Process complete project
gbts all --path ./my-gameboy-game/
```

GBTS's key innovation lies in its **2-pass architecture**:

1. **First pass**: Complete project analysis to understand structure
2. **Second pass**: Contextualized transpilation with GameBoy optimizations

## Advanced Technical Features

### Multi-Provider AI with Automatic Fallback

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet",
    "fallback": ["openai", "claude"]
  }
}
```

GBTS supports **Claude Sonnet 4** and **GPT-4**, with automatic fallback in case of unavailability. This redundancy ensures maximum uptime.

### Intelligent Dependency Management

```typescript
// game.ts
import { Sprite } from './graphics';
import { SoundEngine } from './audio';

class GameBoy {
    private sprite: Sprite;
    private sound: SoundEngine;
    
    initialize(): void {
        // GBTS automatically understands relationships
        this.sprite.load("hero.png");
        this.sound.playBGM("theme.wav");
    }
}
```

The AI analyzes **all project dependencies** simultaneously, avoiding transpilation inconsistencies that plague traditional tools.

### Smart Caching and Cost Optimization

```bash
# Automatic result caching
gbts --path game.ts # First run: API called
gbts --path game.ts # Subsequent runs: cache used
```

The **caching system** drastically reduces API costs while accelerating the development workflow.

## Practical Example: Hello World GameBoy

### TypeScript Source Code

```typescript
// hello-world.ts
function main(): void {
    console.log("Hello GameBoy World!");
    
    // Simple main loop
    while (true) {
        // Basic game logic
        updateGame();
    }
}

function updateGame(): void {
    // Game update logic
}

main();
```

### Optimized C Result (AI-generated)

```c
#include <gb/gb.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void updateGame(void) {
    // Game update logic
}

void main(void) {
    printf("Hello GameBoy World!\n");
    
    // Simple main loop
    while (1) {
        updateGame();
    }
}
```

The AI **understands GameBoy context** and generates idiomatic C code with proper libraries and memory optimizations.

### Current Limitations and Evolution

GBTS is an **actively developed project** with important limitations to consider:

**Technical Limitations:**
- **Complex projects**: Transpilation may fail on very advanced TypeScript architectures
- **External APIs**: Web or Node.js API usage is not supported (GameBoy has no network access)
- **Third-party libraries**: Limited support for complex npm packages
- **Advanced types**: Some sophisticated TypeScript types may cause issues

**Usage Constraints:**
- **AI dependency**: Requires internet connection and API credits
- **Costs**: Large projects may generate significant API fees
- **Performance**: Transpilation can be slow on big projects

**Project Evolution:**
GBTS is designed to evolve significantly. **Pull Requests are highly encouraged!** Priority contribution areas:

- **GameBoy API extension** (audio, graphics, controllers)
- **Complex transpilation patterns** improvement
- **Cost optimization** and intelligent caching
- **Broader TypeScript ecosystem** support
- **Documentation** and practical examples

## Development Workflow Revolution

### Before GBTS: Traditional Workflow

1. **Learn C** for GameBoy (several weeks)
2. **Configure complex toolchain** (SDCC, makefile, etc.)
3. **Develop in C** with extreme memory constraints
4. **Debug** without modern tools
5. **Manually optimize** every instruction

### With GBTS: Modern Workflow

1. **Write in TypeScript** (familiar language)
2. **Transpile with AI** (`gbts --path game.ts`)
3. **Compile automatically** (integrated SDCC)
4. **ROM generated** directly

The productivity gain is **significant**: from weeks to hours to create a functional GameBoy game.

## Installation and Configuration

### Technical Prerequisites

```bash
# Node.js 18+
node --version

# GBTS installation
npm install -g gbts

# API configuration (one of the options)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### Advanced Configuration

```json
{
  "gbts": {
    "ai": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
      "maxTokens": 4000,
      "temperature": 0.1
    },
    "output": {
      "directory": "./output",
      "optimizationLevel": "high"
    },
    "cache": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ttl": 3600
    }
  }
}
```

## Vision and Evolution Perspectives

GBTS represents more than a simple transpiler: it's a **new approach to retro gaming development**.

### Upcoming Features

- **GameBoy Color support** with advanced color management
- **IDE integration** (VS Code extension)
- **TypeScript debugging** with assembly mapping
- **Pre-configured game templates**
- **Specialized AI optimizations** by game genre

### Community Impact

GBTS democratizes GameBoy development by:
