# 2024 Retrospective: Analysis and Technological Prospects for 2025

The year 2024 concludes with a contrasting assessment of major transformations that occurred on both geopolitical, technological, personal, and professional levels. This period was characterized by an acceleration of sectoral changes and significant organizational adjustments. This retrospective analysis aims to examine the key developments of this period before identifying strategic orientations for 2025.

## Macroeconomic and Technological Context of 2024

### National Political Developments

The year saw major political upheavals in France: after the dissolution of the National Assembly by Emmanuel Macron, new legislative elections took place in June. Michel Barnier, initially appointed Prime Minister in September, was ultimately censured by Parliament. In response, Emmanuel Macron designated Fran√ßois Bayrou as the new head of government. These political adjustments will undoubtedly have repercussions on technological and innovation policies in 2025.

### Large-Scale Cultural Events

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, held in Paris, constituted a global technological showcase for France. Beyond their sporting dimension, these events demonstrated the country's digital infrastructure capabilities and technological innovation.

### Acceleration of AI Adoption

2024 will remain a symbolic year for artificial intelligence, marked by the maturation of industrial applications and the democratization of generative AI tools. The integration of these technologies into business processes has become widespread, transforming traditional approaches to software development and automation.

## Personal and Family Developments

This year was marked by significant personal developments, particularly the adaptation to parental responsibilities with my daughter's first birthday. This transition required adjustments in work organization and priority management, illustrating the importance of work-life balance in career evolution.

Adapting to this new family context also influenced technological and methodological choices, favoring efficiency and work time optimization.

## Technical Achievements of 2024

### MySQL to PostgreSQL Database Migration

One of the year's major missions consisted of migrating several MySQL databases to PostgreSQL using **pgloader**. This migration enabled leveraging PostgreSQL's advanced features while automating conversion processes. The open-source project [pgloader-mysql-to-postgresql](https://github.com/Lingelo/pgloader-mysql-to-postgresql) documents this migration methodology.

This experience reinforced expertise in relational database management and large-scale migration strategies.

### Advanced Auth0 Customization

Auth0 skill development focused on advanced concepts:

- Creation of **Actions** for authentication flow enrichment
- Integration of **custom databases** for complex user management
- Interface and communication customization in **multilingual** environments

The [auth0-international-email](https://github.com/Lingelo/auth0-international-email) project illustrates these developments, particularly for international communication management.

### Integrated AI Assistant Development

The implementation of an **OpenAI**-based AI assistant enabled creating a WhatsApp interface for automated order taking. This solution simplified the user experience by eliminating the need for traditional web navigation.

This achievement demonstrates the practical integration of conversational AI technologies into concrete business applications.

### Technical Project Diversification

The year was also marked by intervention domain diversification, particularly strengthening backend development and system architecture skills.
