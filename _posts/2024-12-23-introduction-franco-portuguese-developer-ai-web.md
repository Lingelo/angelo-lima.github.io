# Introduction: Franco-Portuguese Developer Specialized in AI and Web Development

## Why a blog? And why here?

Let me introduce myself: Angelo Lima, a Franco-Portuguese developer passionate about coffee and technology. Since my beginnings in 2013, I've traveled a path made of lines of code, in-depth tutorials, and constant learning, particularly with JavaScript and its subtleties.

Before going further, allow me to answer an essential question: *Why create a new blog in this already dense ecosystem?*

### The real reason: sharing and connecting

The objective of this blog is based on a simple approach: sharing experiences and knowledge. I want to share:
- **My technical discoveries**: development methods, challenges encountered, frameworks explored, and technologies adopted.
- **Technology culture**: innovations, tools, equipment, and trends that shape our sector.
- **Personal reflections**: analyses, observations, and perspectives on the evolution of our field.

I wanted to create an accessible and authentic space, comparable to an informal but enriching discussion place. Whether you're a beginner in computer science, an experienced professional, or simply curious about the behind-the-scenes of development, you'll find relevant content here.

## Who am I? And why development?

Allow me to contextualize my journey. I belong to the generation that experienced the digital transition, from the era of 56k modems to current smartphones, which has given me a unique perspective on technological evolution.

My developer journey began in 2013 with three years of intensive learning. This period was marked by phases of questioning my professional path, but also by those revealing moments when concepts come together and programming logic becomes intuitive.

Today, development represents much more than a professional activity for me: it's my problem-solving method, my creation tool, and my engine for permanent learning. It's this passion that I want to transmit through this blog.
